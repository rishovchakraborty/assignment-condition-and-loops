Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. In JavaScript, there are mainly three types of conditional statements: if, else if, and else

Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    //    Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    //    Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    //    Code to be executed if none of the conditions is true
 }
