Loops in programming are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures, and controlling the flow of a program.

There are several types of loops in JavaScript, including for, while, and do-while loops.

1. for Loop:
We use for loop to run a piece of code until the set condition turns false. The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. Its syntax is as follows:
for (initial Expression; condition; update Expression) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}

for example check answer3-loops.js file

2. while Loop:
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as a specified condition is true. Its syntax is:

while (condition) {
  // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}

for example check answer3-loops.js file

3. do while Loop:
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition. Its syntax is:
do {
  // Code to be executed at least once
} while (condition);
